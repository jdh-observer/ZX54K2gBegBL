Queer sapphic spatial practices in New York City leave uneven documentary traces, making them difficult to study through conventional geospatial datasets. This article examines that unevenness as a problem of legibility and develops a layered evidentiary method for reading it historically. It assembles an address-based spatial corpus from multiple New York City sources produced under different documentary regimes, harmonizes a minimal shared schema, and geocodes entries where coordinates are missing. The address-based layer is organized at a decade scale and explored through an interactive timeline that enables source-aware comparison of where records cluster, thin out, or diverge, without treating any single dataset as definitive. The study also introduces a participant-generated register of ten interviews and sketch maps to support a parallel reading of relational and episodic spatial knowledge. Taken together, the project offers a source-critical way to interpret gaps in address-based spatial history as historically meaningful signals of legibility conditions.
